•	Extracted valuable insights from provided dataset using NLP techniques - text summarization, NER, and word frequency analysis.

Data Analytics In Practice Case 5 Group python code Project Description: 

This project focuses on analyzing text data related to child safeguarding and domestic abuse issues using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes Python's SpaCy library for tasks such as text summarization, named entity recognition (NER), and word frequency analysis. The analysis aims to extract key insights, identify common themes, and visualize important aspects of the text data.

Key Features:

Text summarization to condense lengthy documents into key points. Named entity recognition (NER) to identify and categorize entities such as organizations, dates, and legal acts. Word frequency analysis to identify common themes and topics. Visualization of word frequencies using word clouds, histograms, and heatmaps for better interpretation.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to perform text analysis on your data. Explore the generated visualizations and extracted insights from the analysis.

Requirements:

Python 3.x SpaCy library Matplotlib WordCloud Pandas Seaborn.

Tools Used:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques
Text Summarization
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Word Frequency Analysis
Data Pre-processing Tools

Problem:

The primary concern of this project was to analyze and understand the dataset extracted from a JSON file, specifically focusing on safeguarding children and preventing domestic abuse. The goal was to extract meaningful insights that could inform stakeholders and practitioners in the field of child protection and domestic abuse prevention.

Action Taken:

Data Collection:

The dataset was obtained from a JSON file, focusing on the section titled "Safeguarding Children Level 2."
Text Pre-processing:

The text was cleaned by removing stop words and punctuation to prepare it for computational analysis.
Text Summarization:

Extractive summarization techniques were used to condense the text into key points. This involved assigning importance scores to sentences based on word frequency.
Named Entity Recognition (NER):

NER was applied to identify and categorize entities such as organizations, dates, and cardinal numbers within the text.
Word Frequency Analysis:

A bag-of-words approach was used to quantify the frequency of words, uncovering common themes and topics prevalent in the text.

Solutions:

Summarized Key Points:

The summarization process highlighted essential actions and services available for support, identification of family issues, and pathways for referral and intervention.
Identification of Named Entities:

Entities such as legal acts, organizations, and dates were systematically identified, providing a clearer understanding of the text's content.
Thematic Analysis:

Word frequency analysis revealed recurring themes, emphasizing topics such as child welfare, legal compliance, and support services.

Summary:
The project successfully utilized NLP techniques to analyze a dataset focusing on safeguarding children and domestic abuse prevention. By summarizing key points, identifying significant entities, and uncovering common themes, the analysis provided actionable insights. These insights are valuable for professionals involved in child protection and welfare services, facilitating better understanding and decision-making. The project's findings underscore the importance of legal compliance, collaborative efforts, and clear referral pathways in safeguarding children. The detailed methodology and results highlight the potential of AI-driven analysis to enhance learning and inform policy development in child protection.
